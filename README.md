Welcome to my SQL Learning Journey Repository! As a student eager to explore the world of SQL and database programming, I've created this repository to document and share my progress. This repository serves as a platform for uploading my solutions, exercises, and projects related to SQL, helping me track my learning journey while also sharing my experiences with others.

# **What's Inside:**

1. **Solutions:** This section contains my solutions to SQL exercises, challenges, and projects I've undertaken during my learning process. Feel free to explore and provide feedback or suggestions.

2. **Exercises:** As I work through SQL-related exercises and problems, I'll upload them here. You can find questions and answers for each exercise, allowing me to practice and refine my SQL skills.

3. **Projects:** I'll showcase SQL projects that I'm passionate about or have worked on as part of my learning journey. These projects might range from data analysis to database design, offering a practical application of my SQL knowledge.

4. **Progress Tracking:** I'll maintain a log or README file to keep track of my learning progress. It will include details like the topics I've covered, resources I've used, and any challenges or insights I've encountered along the way.

## **How You Can Help:**

- If you're experienced in SQL, your feedback on my solutions and projects would be greatly appreciated. I'm open to constructive criticism and suggestions to improve my skills.
